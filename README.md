# Carbon Saver - Sustainable Transportation Tracker

- A comprehensive iOS application that encourages sustainable transportation by tracking user routes and calculating carbon emissions saved compared to driving a car. 
- You are able to collect the points that are proportional to the carbon emissions saved for each trip. 
- The collected points can be used to plant a real tree or donate to support projects under your name. 

## Features

### üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Transportation Tracking
- **Multiple Transportation Types**: Walking, Cycling, Bus, Train, Metro, Driving(Car)
- **Real-time Location Tracking**: Real-time location tracking every 5 seconds
- **Route Visualization**: Interactive map showing your journey
- **Distance Calculation**: Accurate distance measurement in kilometers (In the future, we might improve this to be distance measured in meters when it's smaller than 1km - should be a better visualisation to see 50m rather than 0.05km)

### üå± Carbon Emission Calculation
- **Smart Calculations**: Compares your transportation choice with car emissions
- **Points System**: Earn points based on carbon emissions saved (1 kg CO2 = 100 points)

### üéÅ Redemption System
- **Plant a Tree**: 2000 points - We'll plant a tree in your name
- **Environmental Donation**: 1500 points - Support conservation projects
- **Carbon Offset Certificate**: 3000 points - Receive a certificate

### üìä User Profile & Statistics
- **Trip History**: View all your completed trips
- **Total Statistics**: Track total distance, carbon saved, and points earned
- **Personal Dashboard**: Monitor your environmental impacts!

## Carbon Emission Data

The app uses scientifically-based carbon emission factors:

| Transportation | CO2 per km | Points per km |
|----------------|------------|---------------|
| Walking/Cycling | 0.0 kg | 17 points |
| Bus | 0.0 kg | 17 points |
| Train | 0.0 kg | 17 points |
| Metro | 0.0 kg | 17 points |
| Car (baseline) | 0.171 kg | 0 points |

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **Core Location**: GPS tracking and location services
- **MapKit**: Interactive map display and route visualization
- **UserDefaults**: Local data persistence (Future work to integrate database to ensure user information security)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
